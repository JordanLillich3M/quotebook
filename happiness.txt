True happiness is to enjoy the present, without anxious dependence upon the future. Lucius Annaeus Seneca

I've wandered to the limits of my understanding any number of times, out into that desolation...and I've scared myself, too, a good many times, leaving all alndmarks behind. And it as been among the true pleasures of my life. Marilynne Robinson
